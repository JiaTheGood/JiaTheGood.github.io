                <h4 class="text-left">Idea</h4>
                <p class="font-weight-light">  Taking photos became my habit since high school and I found it is a good way to memory things (since I am bad at memorizing things). So I decided to set the theme for the project website as 'photo gallery'. </p><p class="font-weight-light">By studying numbers of photograph websites (including the famous photographer Wolfgang’s personal <a href="https://tillmans.co.uk/">https://tillmans.co.uk/</a> and Cai’s art demonstration site <a href="https://www.artsy.net/caistudio">https://www.artsy.net/caistudio/</a>), as well as thinking about my needs for the website, I came up with the early stage ideology for the website which is a simple/clean website with black/white color scheme.
 I create the website's logo based on my Chinese version middle name '佳Jia ’. The word has the meaning of ‘beautiful and good’ as I want to present all the good things I captured by my phone.
</p>

                <h4 class="text-left">IA/ Wireframe</h4>
                <p class="font-weight-light">Then I came up with the early stage IA along with three types of navigation. Navigation including structural navigation (home- about, contact, gallery,etc.), associative navigation (gallery preview- gallery ,etc.), and utility navigation (social button). With the study from my target websites and IA, I chose to create a simple and clean website layout.
                </p><p class="font-weight-light">I decide to separate different contents by using container images. Every text area will follow by one image area, by doing that, browsers would feel more interesting to look at my content
                  </p>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                  <h2 class="text-center display-4 ">Website Production Process</h2>
                                <hr>
                                <h4 class="text-left">Style</h4>
                  <p class="font-weight-light">The style of this website would be a white background and black text. The Black/white color scheme keeps the website simple, fresh, and clean. Also, such a color scheme may increase website usability because website users can clearly see the content. White background reinforces the demonstration of my image. I also applied image background for numbers features such as jumbotron, progress bar, card, etc.</p>
                                <hr>
                                <h4 class="text-left">Navbar and Footer</h4>
                                <p class="font-weight-light">I styled navbar and footer with white/black color scheme. Navbar contains my logo, home, about, gallery, contact, and document. I made the gallery section drop-down features because I have two pages for gallery.
                                </p><p class="font-weight-light">I applied the col-4 feature for my footer in terms to contains features including social media link- icon, copyright text, as well as my website logo. By doing that, browsers can have easy access to my social media when they want to explore more about me. Additionally, I added _blank class so users can explore my social media in the new window. Such an action increased web accessibility and usability.
                                </p>

                <h4 class="text-left">Homepage</h4>
                <p class="font-weight-light">Each page of my website contains different typologies. For the homepage, I made a landing image/text. The image I selected carries out a function of dark background in which landing text can be clearly demonstrated. Plus, the landing image provides browsers the first impression about this website (which is photograph related). I applied my logo and name as landing text along with a simple intro about this site (this is a portfolio website…). Then there is a button that links to 'about' page.</p>
                <p class="font-weight-light">The next section is a brief introduction to my idea of making this website. Such type of content often belongs to the 'About' site, but I had applied it here to provide website users a better understanding of the site. It is an application of the principle of disclosure.
                After that, there are card features that link to my gallery pages. I implied images on the card in which browsers can do a little preview on the photo. This is an implementation of the principle of exemplar.
                </p>
                              <hr>
                              <h4 class="text-left">About</h4>
                <p class="font-weight-light">For this page, I managed to keep the balance between image and text content. For the layout, I put one text section after an image section. Plus, I applied photo backgrounds for jumbotron and progress bars in terms to demonstrate my work better. Such a layout and style may ensure browsers' interests to browse. Additionally, they can look at my image and content at the same time.
 </p><p class="font-weight-light">Again, some photos that been applied on the 'About' page, can also be found on the 'Gallery 'page. Such an act may promote website browsers to look at my gallery page.

</p>
                              <hr>
                              <h4 class="text-left">Gallery</h4>
                <p class="font-weight-light">Both gallery sites applied mp4 videos as jumbotron's background. Such an application may give browsers a fresh look because all other pages implied static images. </p><p class="font-weight-light">I applied jumbotron bg-dark for page 'Blue!' and bg-white for page '07' based on the differences between two video's color/feeling.
 Browsers may see the full-size photo along with its caption, by clicking the small photos. Also, the carousel feature increases usability because users can easily see the next photo be clicking.
</p>

                                <hr>
                                <h4 class="text-left">Contact</h4>
                                <p class="font-weight-light">For the contact, I decided to try something different from my other pages. First, I found the regular contact is lacking some design, so I added a colorful photo as background, to furthermore demonstrate my work.
                                </p><p class="font-weight-light">Then I played around with float feature and made structural changes to the email contact form. I intentionally deconstructed the email form and made some separation. I placed form-parts around the 'cloud' and added 'Looking forward to hearing from you :)’ text on the top of the ‘Submit’ button (to make it looks cute). From my perspective, I ensured both design and function for the page, and I also made the contact page very interesting to browse.
                                </p>

                                <hr>
                                <h4 class="text-left">Some styles/decorations </h4>
                                <p class="font-weight-light">Homepage button:  Made it semi-transparent to look good with the landing image area.

Progress bar section: every progress bar has different opacity with differences of 0.1
                                </p>
